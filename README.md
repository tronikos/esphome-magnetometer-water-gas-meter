# esphome-magnetometer-water-gas-meter [![Made for ESPHome](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made_for-ESPHome-black?logo=esphome)](https://esphome.io)

This [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) package allows reading your water meter or gas meter using the QMC5883L or HMC5883L, a triple-axis magnetometer.

TLDR; Add this to your ESPHome device configuration:

```yaml
substitutions:
  volume_unit: 'gal'
  i2c_scl: GPIO5  # D1
  i2c_sda: GPIO4  # D2
  # Set to false only if needed during manual calibration.
  # Do not keep them at false since these slow down the ESP device
  # and reduce the accuracy during high flow.
  hide_magnetic_field_strength_sensors: 'true'
  hide_half_rotations_total_sensor: 'true'

packages:
  meter:
    url: https://github.com/tronikos/esphome-magnetometer-water-gas-meter
    ref: main
    file: esphome-water-meter.yaml
    # Or for gas meter:
    # file: esphome-gas-meter.yaml
    # Or if you are using HMC5883L instead of QMC5883L:
    # files: [esphome-water-meter.yaml, hmc5883l.yaml]
    refresh: 0s
```

## Compatibility

### Water meter

The magnetometer is used to read the rotating magnet inside your water meter.

This should be compatible will all the water meters the Flume water sensor is compatible with, which is [compatible](https://help.flumewater.com/en/articles/1618594-is-the-flume-device-compatible-with-all-water-meters) with about 95% of water meters in the United States.

To verify compatibility follow [this](https://help.flumewater.com/en/articles/1618594-is-the-flume-device-compatible-with-all-water-meters). Alternatively, install the Sensors app on your phone, place your phone next to the meter, and see if the Geomagnetic Field sensors are changing while water is running.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9nVkSZ6_H4) showing the internals of a water meter.

See [Figure 1: Nutating disc operation](https://www.instrumart.com/assets/RCDL-manual.pdf)

"The metering principle, known as positive displacement, is based on the continuous filling and discharging of the measuring
chamber. Controlled clearances between the disc and the chamber provide precise measurement of each volume cycle.
As the disc nutates, the center spindle rotates a magnet. The movement of the magnet is sensed through the meter wall
by a follower magnet or by various sensors. Each revolution of the magnet is equivalent to a fixed volume of fluid, which is
converted to any engineering unit of measure for totalization, indication or process control."

### Gas meter

The magnetometer is used to read the diaphragm that expands and contracts inside your gas meter.

This should be compatible with all diaphragm/bellows meters which are the most common type of gas meter, seen in almost all residential and small commercial installations.

To verify compatibility install the Sensors app on your phone, place your phone next to the meter, and see if the Geomagnetic Field sensors are changing while gas is running.

## Hardware installation

### Parts

- ESP8266 or ESP32 with power adapter
  - I placed mine inside the garage
  - For high flow meters a dual core ESP32 is strongly preferred
- QMC5883L or HMC5883L magnetometer
  - I placed mine in the water meter box 20ft away from the garage
- Ethernet cable
  - I used 32.8ft or 10m direct burial CAT6. A user has reported they successfully used 75ft or 22.9m direct burial CAT6.
  - CAT6 is preferred because of its lower capacitance. CAT5 50ft or 15m [should work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v1KZBRZRCI). For 100ft you will need an active terminator such as [LTC4311](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWPxO7jx_o).
- Some way to weather proof the magnetometer. Some options:
  - Adhesive 4:1 heat shrink tubing (this is what I used)
  - Liquid electrical tape
  - Silicone sealant
  - Nail polish
  - Hot glue
- Some way to mount the magnetometer on the meter. Some options:
  - Cable zip tie (this is what I used)
  - Duct tape
- Conduit for the ethernet cable. Can be skipped if using direct burial ethernet cable.

### Wiring

QMC5883L | ESP8266
--- | ---
VCC | 5V
GND | GND
SCL | D1
SDA | D2

The ethernet cable has 4 twisted pairs of wires. Use any solid wire color for the 4 above pins. Tie the 4 white wires together with the GND solid wire. You might need to use a header pin for the GND. If you use a header pin cut the 5 GND wires shorter to avoid the ball of wires I had...

## Software installation

1. Setup **ESPHome**, if you don't have it already, by following [Getting Started with ESPHome and Home Assistant](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html).
2. In the **ESPHome Dashboard** select **New device**, **Continue**, give a name: e.g. Water meter, **Next**, select device type based on the ESP chip used e.g. ESP8266.
3. In the **Configuration created!** page select **Skip** to skip installation for now until we make a few changes.
4. Select **Edit** on the created configuration e.g. water-meter.yaml.
5. Skip this step if you used an `esp32`. Change `esp8266` section to:

    ```yaml
    esp8266:
      board: d1_mini
      restore_from_flash: true

    preferences:
      flash_write_interval: 60min
    ```

6. Add the following (either at the beginning or the end of the file):

    ```yaml
    substitutions:
      # For water one of: CCF, ft続, gal, L, m続
      # For gas one of: CCF, ft続, m続
      volume_unit: 'gal'
      i2c_scl: GPIO5  # D1
      i2c_sda: GPIO4  # D2
      # Set to false only if needed during manual calibration.
      # Do not keep them at false since these slow down the ESP device
      # and reduce the accuracy during high flow.
      hide_magnetic_field_strength_sensors: 'true'
      hide_half_rotations_total_sensor: 'true'

    packages:
      meter:
        url: https://github.com/tronikos/esphome-magnetometer-water-gas-meter
        ref: main
        file: esphome-water-meter.yaml
        # Or for gas meter:
        # file: esphome-gas-meter.yaml
        # Or if you are using HMC5883L instead of QMC5883L:
        # files: [esphome-water-meter.yaml, hmc5883l.yaml]
        refresh: 0s
    ```

7. Change the values in the `substitutions` section based on your setting, e.g. if you have used different pins, or if you prefer a different unit.
8. Your configuration should now look something like the following:

    ```yaml
    substitutions:
      volume_unit: 'gal'
      i2c_scl: GPIO5  # D1
      i2c_sda: GPIO4  # D2
      # Set to false only if needed during manual calibration.
      # Do not keep them at false since these slow down the ESP device
      # and reduce the accuracy during high flow.
      hide_magnetic_field_strength_sensors: 'true'
      hide_half_rotations_total_sensor: 'true'

    packages:
      meter:
        url: https://github.com/tronikos/esphome-magnetometer-water-gas-meter
        ref: main
        file: esphome-water-meter.yaml
        # Or for gas meter:
        # file: esphome-gas-meter.yaml
        refresh: 0s

    esphome:
      name: water-meter
      friendly_name: Water meter

    esp8266:
      board: d1_mini
      restore_from_flash: true

    preferences:
      flash_write_interval: 60min

    # Enable logging
    logger:

    # Enable Home Assistant API
    api:
      encryption:
        key: "L8408egzTATPCBT1nzvFpqj4YlVERRO31+GyB/yjf4E="

    ota:

        password: "d44ed9df293facf65e288062d5c7a5e7"

    wifi:
      ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
      password: !secret wifi_password

      # Enable fallback hotspot (captive portal) in case wifi connection fails
      ap:
        ssid: "water-meter Fallback Hotspot"
        password: "8cSGOshkb2Rw"

    captive_portal:
        
    ```

9. Select **Save** and then **Install**.
10. Only for the first install select **Plug into this computer**. For subsequent updates/installs you can install **Wirelessly**.
11. Select **Download project** to save a bin file.
12. Select **Open ESPHome Web**, **Connect**, **Install downloaded project**.
13. In the **Install your existing ESPHome project** page select **Choose File**, select the previously downloaded bin file, and select **Install**.
14. Home Assistant should auto-discover your new device.

## Calibration

### Magnetic field axis and thresholds

To calibrate these just run a light stream of water/gas and press the "Calibrate axis" button. After 5 seconds (configurable) the proper axis and thresholds should be set.

Alternatively:

1. Temporarily set `hide_magnetic_field_strength_sensors: 'false'` to show the Magnetic Field Strength X, Y, and Z sensors in HA.
2. Run a light stream of water/gas.
3. Observe which axis changes the most and its range.
4. Set the axis and thresholds. e.g. if y axis ranges from min to max use:

    ```raw
    Axis = y
    Threshold lower = min + 0.25 * (max - min)
    Threshold upper = max - 0.25 * (max - min)
    ```

5. Set `hide_magnetic_field_strength_sensors: 'true'`.

### Volume per half rotation

This depends on your specific water/gas meter model and its size.

You can search for specifications of your specific water/gas meter and its size. e.g.
for [Neptune T-10](https://www.riotronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NT10-4P-WaterRead-pdf3.01.pdf):

Meter size | Pulses/Gallon
--- | ---
5/8"       | 231.24
3/4"       | 129.04
1"         | 60.32
1 1/2"     | 27.03
2"         | 14.92

So for a 5/8" Neptune T-10 you will set this to `0.00864902` (2 / 231.24)

If you have the Flume water sensor you can use its lowest reported value. You can find it with:
`select min(min) from statistics_short_term, statistics_meta where statistics_meta.statistic_id = 'sensor.water_usage_current' and statistics_meta.id = metadata_id and min > 0;`

Alternatively:

1. Temporarily set `hide_half_rotations_total_sensor: 'false'` to show the "Half rotations total" sensor in HA.
2. Write it down and also write down the reading on your water/gas meter.
3. After a few hours or even days of regular water/gas usage, write down both of them again.
4. Set this to the result of: diff of readings in volume_unit divided by diff of half rotations.
5. Set `hide_half_rotations_total_sensor: 'true'`.

For water meters this defaults to `0.01008156 gal` which is for my 3/4" Badge Meter Model 35.
For gas meters this defaults to `0.125 ft続` which seems to be the most common in US.
If you have modified the `volume_unit` you have to manually convert this value.
E.g. if for gas you used `volume_unit: 'CCF'` then you need to set the volume per half rotation to: `0.00125 CCF` (just search on Google `0.125 ft続 to CCF`).

### Temperature

Only supported if you are using a QMC5883L.
Place another temperature sensor next to the QMC5883L and adjust the temperature offset so that they match.

## Home Assistant alerts

I'm using the [Alert integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alert/) to get alerted if there is a leak.

In `/homeassistant/configuration.yaml` I have:

```yaml
alert: !include alerts.yaml

template:
  - sensor:
    - name: Water running for 45 minutes
      unique_id: water_running_45min
      device_class: "moisture"
      icon: mdi:waves
      delay_on:
        minutes: 45
      # Subtract irrigation system that consumes 0.28 gal/min between 7 to 9 am or 8 to 10 am depending on DST
      state: "{{ max(0, states('sensor.water_meter_flow') | float - (0.3 if now().hour in range(7, 10) else 0)) > 0 }}"
    - name: Water running for 20 minutes at more than 1.5 gal/min
      unique_id: water_running_20min
      device_class: "moisture"
      icon: mdi:waves
      delay_on:
        minutes: 20
      state: "{{ max(0, states('sensor.water_meter_flow') | float - (0.3 if now().hour in range(7, 10) else 0)) > 1.5 }}"

```

In `Settings > Devices & services > Helpers` I have created a group `binary_sensor.water_leak_sensors_group` with the above 2 sensors together with all my water leak sensors.

In `Settings > Automations` I have created the following automation to get notified if I ever forget to add a new sensor to the group:

```yaml
alias: "Notify: incomplete groups"
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: time
    at: "10:01:00"
action:
  - if:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ missing_moisture_sensors != '' }}"
    then:
      - service: notify.nikos
        data:
          message: |-
            binary_sensor.water_leak_sensors_group is missing:

        | reject('in', states.binary_sensor.water_leak_sensors_group.attributes.entity_id)
        | join('\n') }}

```

In `/homeassistant/alerts.yaml` I have the following to keep alerting me every 5 minutes in case of a leak:

```yaml
water_leak:
  name: Water leak detected
  message: "Water leak detected at {{ expand('binary_sensor.water_leak_sensors_group') | selectattr('state', '==', 'on') | map(attribute='attributes.friendly_name') | join(', ') | lower() | replace(': water leak sensor', '') | replace(' leak sensor moisture', '') }} {{ relative_time(states.binary_sensor.water_leak_sensors_group.last_changed) }} ago"

In my main dashboard I have the following [auto-entities](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities) card, which is typically hidden when empty:

```yaml

    - domain: binary_sensor
      attributes:
        device_class: moisture
      not:
        state: 'off'
```

In `Settings > Devices & services > Helpers` I have created a Utility Meter `sensor.water_meter_daily_total` to keep track of my daily water usage.

In `Settings > Automations` I have created the following automation to get notified if my daily water usage is abnormal:

```yaml
